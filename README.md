![Capa](https://img.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/images/logo.png)


I'm releasing this version because maybe it can be useful to someone

**But this version is not perfection**

Sometimes because of how the searchs works in mastel duel some cards may be wrong in your deck after the macro ends

And still need to change some settings before to using the macro

**Requirements:**
