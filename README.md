# Attention
Some buttons can trigger your anti-virus at the first click them
it's because the macro modify two files in the folder config_print
config.txt saves some useful settings
print.png is a print that the macro used to read the name of cards


# This version is not perfection

- Executable size is too big 
- And you still need to change some settings before to using the macro
- ugly interface
- I can do it better and i accept help
