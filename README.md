I'm releasing this version because maybe it can be useful to someone
## Download to Executable

## **This version is not perfection**

- Executable size is too big 
- Sometimes because of how the searchs works in mastel duel some cards may be wrong in your deck after the macro ends
- And you still need to change some settings before to using the macro
